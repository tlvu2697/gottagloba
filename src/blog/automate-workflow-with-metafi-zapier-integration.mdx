Connect events to your CRM, billing, and support tools with least-privilege tokens and replay-safe webhooks.

## Why Zapier?

Teams already automate everything—from sending Slack messages to syncing billing data. But until now, Metafi customers had to build custom integrations. With our new Zapier app, automation is a few clicks away.

## What You Can Do

- Sync new customers to HubSpot automatically.
- Trigger Slack alerts when a subscription is paused.
- Update invoices in QuickBooks the moment payments post.

Every action happens through a secure, scoped token with least-privilege access.

## Architecture: Secure and Replay-Safe

We designed the integration to prevent replay attacks. Each webhook carries a timestamp and signature verified by Metafi.  
Failed events are retried safely, and duplicates are ignored.

## Developer Friendly

For power users, you can chain Zaps to create multi-step automations.  
Want to reconcile a Stripe charge, notify finance, and update your CRM? You can do that in one flow—without writing code.

## The Bigger Picture

Automation isn’t about eliminating humans—it’s about giving them leverage.  
By connecting Metafi with Zapier, we’ve turned data into a living workflow engine.
