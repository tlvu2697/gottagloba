## Why “interactive docs”?

Docs that answer themselves reduce support load and lift adoption. We describe our block protocol, live components, and Slack surface.

## The Problem with Static Docs

Most documentation is read-only. When users hit a question, they leave the page—or worse, churn.  
We wanted docs that _respond_ to input, show live API examples, and even work directly inside Slack.

## The Block Protocol

We built a “block protocol” that lets writers embed live components—forms, code runners, or data previews—directly in Markdown.  
Each block is sandboxed, versioned, and composable.

## Rendering in Slack

Slack’s Block Kit made it possible to render these docs as interactive threads.  
When a user types `/metafi help`, they see the same doc rendered with buttons, dropdowns, and API previews—all without leaving chat.

## Why It Works

Support teams now close tickets faster. Developers stay in context.  
Interactive docs aren’t a marketing gimmick—they’re the next evolution of self-service education.
