- Granular approval policies

## From “Admin” to “Intelligence Layer”

The traditional back office was built for reconciliation. Today, it’s an operational nerve center—where finance meets data engineering. Our latest Metafi updates are designed to help businesses see revenue in motion.

By connecting billing, usage tracking, and CRM events, we enable companies to manage ARR, recognize revenue automatically, and close books in hours, not days.

## Unified Data and Event-Driven Logic

Our system listens to product events (subscriptions, upgrades, refunds) and translates them into accounting entries automatically.  
When a user upgrades, a corresponding revenue recognition entry is generated instantly. CFOs see financials that are always in sync with product reality.

## Policy Control for Modern Teams

We introduced **granular approval policies**—so finance can control thresholds and exceptions. You can require multi-level approvals for credits above certain amounts, or restrict who can modify contract terms.

This not only improves compliance but builds trust between teams.

## Dashboards Built for Decision-Making

Revenue operations teams need context, not spreadsheets.  
Metafi’s dashboards combine financial and product data to surface anomalies—churn risk, delayed payments, or underutilized accounts.

Our health dashboard updates in real time, giving leaders early warning on trends before they hit the books.

## Why This Matters

In a world of automated growth, companies that treat their back office as a growth engine, not an afterthought, win.  
Data consistency, audit readiness, and speed of insight all compound.

A dynamic back office doesn’t slow you down—it’s what makes scale possible.
