Step-by-step guide: events in, invoices out, and how to avoid double-counting.

---

## Overview

Ghost powers the content layer; Metafi handles the financial layer.  
Connecting the two lets you track revenue per subscriber, automate invoices, and sync churn events.

## Setup Steps

1. **Create a Metafi account** and generate an API key.
2. **Install the Ghost integration** via your admin panel.
3. **Map your Ghost members** to Metafi customers.
4. **Test a subscription event**—it should appear instantly in your Metafi dashboard.

## Preventing Double-Counting

When Ghost sends subscription renewals, Metafi verifies via event ID to ensure each transaction is unique.  
We store a checksum per event to make reconciliation deterministic.

## Why It Matters

For creators, the hardest part of growth is visibility.  
By syncing Ghost and Metafi, you see true MRR, active members, and refunds—all in one place.

Integrations should amplify creativity, not distract from it.
